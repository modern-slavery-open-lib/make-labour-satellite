# Labour satellite

This tool unpacks public labour data and rewrites it in a format for the OAASIS project - the Open analysis to address slavery in supply chains (https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-areas/physics/big-data-combatting-modern-slavery.html).

The output format is a 'satellite' account for an environmentally-extended input-output model (EEIO). Currently the OAASIS project is using the GLORIA MRIO model (https://ielab.info/analyse/gloria).
